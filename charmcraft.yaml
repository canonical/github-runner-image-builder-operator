  A [Juju](https://juju.is/) [charm](https://juju.is/docs/olm/charmed-operators) managing
  runner images for
  [self-hosted runners for GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/managing-self-hosted-runners/about-self-hosted-runners).

  A single unit of this charm provides pre-built images for Github runner operator to spawn and
  register the self-hosted runners on Github. The charm will periodically rebuild and provide the
  latest version of the images.
